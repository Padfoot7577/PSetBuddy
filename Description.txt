PsetBuddies is a web app that connects MIT students through analyzing their coursework and study habits using machine learning. We made PSetBuddies during HackMIT 2017 because we believe that colleges are full of outstanding people, and there should be more opportunities for people of congenial academic interests to meet. Especially at MIT, PsetBuddies can pair anyone up with their "PSet soulmate" as long as they enter their information to the database. It's like Tinder for psetting!
