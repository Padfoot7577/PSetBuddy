# PSetBuddies
HackMIT 2017 

Project Description \n
PsetBuddies is a platform that connect MIT students through analyzing their coursework and study habits. 
As students at MIT, we feel that colleges like MIT are full of outstanding people, and there should be more opportunities 
for people of congenial academic interests to meet. 
That's why we made PSetBuddies during HackMIT 2017.
